Berland students are so tough that all they drink is orange juice!</p><p>Yesterday one student, Vasya and his mates made some barbecue and they drank this healthy drink only. After they ran out of the first barrel of juice, they decided to play a simple game. All <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> people who came to the barbecue sat in a circle (thus each person received a unique index <span class="tex-span"><i>b</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> from 0 to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;1</span>). The person number 0 started the game (this time it was Vasya). All turns in the game were numbered by integers starting from 1. If the <span class="tex-span"><i>j</i></span>-th turn was made by the person with index <span class="tex-span"><i>b</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span>, then this person acted like that:</p><ol> <li> he pointed at the person with index <span class="tex-span">(<i>b</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub>&#x2009;+&#x2009;1)&#xA0;<i>mod</i>&#xA0;<i>n</i></span> either with an elbow or with a nod (<span class="tex-span"><i>x</i>&#xA0;<i>mod</i>&#xA0;<i>y</i></span> is the remainder after dividing <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i></span> by <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i></span>); </li><li> if <span class="tex-span"><i>j</i>&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;4</span> and the players who had turns number <span class="tex-span"><i>j</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;1</span>, <span class="tex-span"><i>j</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;2</span>, <span class="tex-span"><i>j</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;3</span>, made during their turns the same moves as player <span class="tex-span"><i>b</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> on the current turn, then he had drunk a glass of juice; </li><li> the turn went to person number <span class="tex-span">(<i>b</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub>&#x2009;+&#x2009;1)&#xA0;<i>mod</i>&#xA0;<i>n</i></span>. </li></ol><p>The person who was pointed on the last turn did not make any actions.</p><p>The problem was, Vasya&apos;s drunk too much juice and can&apos;t remember the goal of the game. However, Vasya&apos;s got the recorded sequence of all the participants&apos; actions (including himself). Now Vasya wants to find out the maximum amount of juice he could drink if he played optimally well (the other players&apos; actions do not change). Help him.</p><p>You can assume that in any scenario, there is enough juice for everybody.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">4&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;2000</span>) &#x2014; the number of participants in the game.
