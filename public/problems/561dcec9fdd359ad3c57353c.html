Later he realized that he doesn&apos;t like how the &#x410;&#x421;&#x41C; contests are organised: the team could only have three members (and he couldn&apos;t take all his friends to the competitions and distribute the tasks between the team members efficiently), so he decided to organize his own contests PFAST Inc. &#x2014; Petr and Friends Are Solving Tasks Corporation. PFAST Inc. rules allow a team to have unlimited number of members.</p><p>To make this format of contests popular he organised his own tournament. To create the team he will prepare for the contest organised by the PFAST Inc. rules, he chose several volunteers (up to 16 people) and decided to compile a team from them. Petya understands perfectly that if a team has two people that don&apos;t get on well, then the team will perform poorly. Put together a team with as many players as possible given that all players should get on well with each other.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integer numbers <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;16</span>) &#x2014; the number of volunteers, and <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> (<img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="http://codeforces.com/predownloaded/9b/07/9b07d4381eb0641662d0fae9fb5943caf8ce77b0.png">) &#x2014; the number of pairs that do not get on.
