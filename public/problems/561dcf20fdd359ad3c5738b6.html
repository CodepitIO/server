All the secrets cost the same: <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> marks. The state which secrets Gerald is selling, has no paper money, only coins. But there are coins of all positive integer denominations that are powers of three: 1 mark, 3 marks, 9 marks, 27 marks and so on. There are no coins of other denominations. Of course, Gerald likes it when he gets money without the change. And all buyers respect him and try to give the desired sum without change, if possible. But this does not always happen.</p><p>One day an unlucky buyer came. He did not have the desired sum without change. Then he took out all his coins and tried to give Gerald a larger than necessary sum with as few coins as possible. What is the maximum number of coins he could get?</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-it">The formal explanation of the previous paragraph:</span> we consider all the possible combinations of coins for which the buyer can not give Gerald the sum of <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> marks without change. For each such combination calculate the minimum number of coins that can bring the buyer at least <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> marks. Among all combinations choose the maximum of the minimum number of coins. This is the number we want.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The single line contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class="upper-index">17</sup></span>).</p><p>Please, do not use the <span class="tex-font-style-tt">%lld</span> specifier to read or write 64 bit integers in &#x421;++.

The buyer cannot give three coins as he wants to minimize the number of coins that he gives.</p></div></div></div>
