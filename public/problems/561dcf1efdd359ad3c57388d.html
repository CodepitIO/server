Your current obstacle is go through the infamous Biridian Forest.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">The forest</span></p><p>The Biridian Forest is a two-dimensional grid consisting of <span class="tex-span"><i>r</i></span> rows and <span class="tex-span"><i>c</i></span> columns. Each cell in Biridian Forest may contain a tree, or may be vacant. A vacant cell may be occupied by zero or more mikemon breeders (there may also be breeders other than you in the forest). Mikemon breeders (including you) cannot enter cells with trees. One of the cells is designated as the exit cell.</p><p>The initial grid, including your initial position, the exit cell, and the initial positions of all other breeders, will be given to you. Here&apos;s an example of such grid (from the first example):</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="http://codeforces.com/predownloaded/a5/a8/a5a88bae091e2185655dead4b8002dde978460aa.png"> </center><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Moves</span></p><p>Breeders (including you) may move in the forest. In a single move, breeders may perform one of the following actions: </p><ul> <li> Do nothing. </li><li> Move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells (two cells are adjacent if they share a side). Note that breeders cannot enter cells with trees. </li><li> If you are located on the exit cell, you may leave the forest. Only you can perform this move &#x2014; all other mikemon breeders will never leave the forest by using this type of movement. </li></ul><p>After each time you make a single move, each of the other breeders simultaneously make a single move (the choice of which move to make may be different for each of the breeders).</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Mikemon battle</span></p><p>If you and <span class="tex-span"><i>t</i></span> <span class="tex-span">(<i>t</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0)</span> mikemon breeders are located on the same cell, exactly <span class="tex-span"><i>t</i></span> mikemon battles will ensue that time (since you will be battling each of those <span class="tex-span"><i>t</i></span> breeders once). After the battle, all of those <span class="tex-span"><i>t</i></span> breeders will leave the forest to heal their respective mikemons.</p><p>Note that the moment you leave the forest, no more mikemon battles can ensue, even if another mikemon breeder move to the exit cell immediately after that. Also note that a battle only happens between you and another breeders &#x2014; there will be no battle between two other breeders (there may be multiple breeders coexisting in a single cell).</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Your goal</span></p><p>You would like to leave the forest. In order to do so, you have to make a sequence of moves, ending with a move of the final type. Before you make any move, however, you post this sequence on your personal virtual idol Blog. Then, you will follow this sequence of moves faithfully.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Goal of other breeders</span></p><p>Because you post the sequence in your Blog, the other breeders will all know your exact sequence of moves even before you make your first move. All of them will move in such way that will guarantee a mikemon battle with you, if possible. The breeders that couldn&apos;t battle you will do nothing.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Your task</span></p><p>Print the minimum number of mikemon battles that you must participate in, assuming that you pick the sequence of moves that minimize this number. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of moves you make.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line consists of two integers: <span class="tex-span"><i>r</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>c</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>r</i>,&#x2009;<i>c</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1000</span>), denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in Biridian Forest.
