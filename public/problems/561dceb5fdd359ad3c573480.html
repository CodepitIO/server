The shopkeeper told Ali that he can buy anything for free if he could answer a simple question in <span class="tex-span">10</span> seconds. But to see the question Ali has to pay 3 tomans.</p><p>Ali agreed instantly and the shopkeeper handed him a piece of paper containing the task. The task was indeed very simple. It said: </p><p><span class="tex-font-style-it">Let string <span class="tex-span"><i>A</i></span> be <span class="tex-font-style-tt">ababababababab</span>. Which non-empty substring of <span class="tex-span"><i>A</i></span> is repeated the most times in it?</span></p><p>Ali answered fast. He said the answer is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">a</span>. But the shopkeeper said that Ali is wrong and asked him to read the rest of statement:</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-it">If several substrings have the maximal repeat time, then the substring with maximal length would be the answer, in case of a tie the alphabetically latest substring will be chosen.</span></p><p>So the answer is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">ab</span>.</p><p>Now Ali wants us to solve this problem for different strings. We don&apos;t have a great advantage over Ali, we just have a computer and a weird language.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The single line consisting of a string <span class="tex-span"><i>A</i></span>.
