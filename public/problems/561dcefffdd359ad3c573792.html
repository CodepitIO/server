He followed the teacher&apos;s advice and did as much as <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> measurements, and recorded the results in the notebook. After that he was about to show the results to the teacher, but he remembered that at the last lesson, the teacher had made his friend Petya redo the experiment because the largest and the smallest results differed by more than two times. Vasya is lazy, and he does not want to redo the experiment. He wants to do the task and go home play computer games. So he decided to cheat: before Vasya shows the measurements to the teacher, he will erase some of them, so as to make the largest and the smallest results of the remaining measurements differ in no more than two times. In other words, if the remaining measurements have the smallest result <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i></span>, and the largest result <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i></span>, then the inequality <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;2&#xB7;<i>x</i></span> must fulfill. Of course, to avoid the teacher&apos;s suspicion, Vasya wants to remove as few measurement results as possible from his notes.</p><p>Help Vasya, find what minimum number of measurement results he will have to erase from his notes so that the largest and the smallest of the remaining results of the measurements differed in no more than two times.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">2&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class="upper-index">5</sup></span>) &#x2014; the number of measurements Vasya made.
