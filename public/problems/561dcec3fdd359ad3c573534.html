One day a problem called &quot;Flags&quot; from a website called Timmy&apos;s Online Judge caught his attention. In the problem one had to find the number of three-colored flags that would satisfy the condition... actually, it doesn&apos;t matter. Igor K. quickly found the formula and got the so passionately desired Accepted.</p><p>However, the professor wasn&apos;t very much impressed. He decided that the problem represented on Timmy&apos;s Online Judge was very dull and simple: it only had three possible colors of flag stripes and only two limitations. He suggested a complicated task to Igor K. and the fellow failed to solve it. Of course, we won&apos;t tell anybody that the professor couldn&apos;t solve it as well.</p><p>And how about you? Can you solve the problem?</p><p>The flags consist of one or several parallel stripes of similar width. The stripes can be one of the following colors: white, black, red or yellow. You should find the number of different flags with the number of stripes from <span class="tex-span"><i>L</i></span> to <span class="tex-span"><i>R</i></span>, if:</p><ul> <li> a flag cannot have adjacent stripes of one color; </li><li> a flag cannot have adjacent white and yellow stripes; </li><li> a flag cannot have adjacent red and black stripes; </li><li> a flag cannot have the combination of black, white and red stripes following one after another in this or reverse order; </li><li> symmetrical flags (as, for example, a WB and a BW flag, where W and B stand for the white and black colors) are considered the same. </li></ul></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The only line contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>L</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>R</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>L</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>R</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>).
