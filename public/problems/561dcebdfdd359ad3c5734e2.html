No, no, there was no firing from machine guns or radiation mutants time-travels!</p><p>There was a beauty named Belle. Once she had violated the Beast&apos;s order and visited the West Wing. After that she was banished from the castle... </p><p>Everybody was upset. The beautiful Belle was upset, so was the Beast, so was Lumiere the candlestick. But the worst thing was that Cogsworth was upset. Cogsworth is not a human, but is the mantel clock, which was often used as an alarm clock.</p><p>Due to Cogsworth&apos;s frustration all the inhabitants of the castle were in trouble: now they could not determine when it was time to drink morning tea, and when it was time for an evening stroll. </p><p>Fortunately, deep in the basement are lying digital clock showing the time in the format <span class="tex-font-style-tt">HH:MM</span>. Now the residents of the castle face a difficult task. They should turn Cogsworth&apos;s hour and minute mustache hands in such a way, that Cogsworth began to show the correct time. Moreover they need to find turn angles in degrees for each mustache hands. The initial time showed by Cogsworth is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">12:00</span>.</p><p>You can only rotate the hands forward, that is, as is shown in the picture: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="http://codeforces.com/predownloaded/25/1f/251ff8d1fcd34ddce0e14fbff449090038e8d552.png"> </center><p>As since there are many ways too select such angles because of full rotations, choose the smallest angles in the right (non-negative) direction.</p><p>Note that Cogsworth&apos;s hour and minute mustache hands move evenly and continuously. Hands are moving independently, so when turning one hand the other hand remains standing still.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The only line of input contains current time according to the digital clock, formatted as <span class="tex-font-style-tt">HH:MM</span> (<span class="tex-span">00&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;</span><span class="tex-font-style-tt">HH</span><span class="tex-span">&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;23</span>, <span class="tex-span">00&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;</span><span class="tex-font-style-tt">MM</span><span class="tex-span">&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;59</span>).
