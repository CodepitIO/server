The teacher gave them <span class="tex-span">3</span> strings and asked them to <span class="tex-font-style-it">concatenate</span> them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Alireza</span> and <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Amir</span> we can get to <span class="tex-font-style-tt">AlirezaAmir</span> or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">AmirAlireza</span> depending on the order of concatenation.</p><p>Unfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.</p><p>Now the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students&apos; papers.</p><p>Shapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here&apos;s what the teacher said: </p><ul> <li> As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students&apos; answers to Latin. </li><li> As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">-</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">;</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">_</span>&quot;. These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them <span class="tex-font-style-it">Signs</span>. </li><li> The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to <span class="tex-span">100</span> and the lengths of my students&apos; answers are less than or equal to <span class="tex-span">600</span> </li><li> My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write <span class="tex-font-style-tt">ALiReZaAmIR</span> instead of <span class="tex-font-style-tt">AlirezaAmir</span>. Don&apos;t be picky and ignore these mistakes. </li><li> Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Iran;;--</span> is the same as <span class="tex-font-style-tt">--;IRAN</span> </li><li> You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">WA</span>&quot; for Wrong answer or &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">ACC</span>&quot; for a correct answer. </li><li> I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. </li><li> Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than <span class="tex-span">2</span> hours to complete this. </li></ul> </div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first three lines contain a string each.
