Although our hero Valera was not present at this spectacular event himself and only watched it on TV, it excited him so much that he decided to enroll in a biathlon section.</p><p>Of course, biathlon as any sport, proved very difficult in practice. It takes much time and effort. Workouts, workouts, and workouts, &#x2014; that&apos;s what awaited Valera on his way to great achievements in biathlon.</p><p>As for the workouts, you all probably know that every professional biathlete should ski fast and shoot precisely at the shooting range. Only in this case you can hope to be successful, because running and shooting are the two main components of biathlon. Valera has been diligent in his ski trainings, which is why he runs really fast, however, his shooting accuracy is nothing to write home about.</p><p>On a biathlon base where Valera is preparing for the competition, there is a huge rifle range with <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> targets. Each target have shape of a circle, and <span class="tex-font-style-bf">the center of each circle is located on the <span class="tex-span"><i>Ox</i></span> axis</span>. At the last training session Valera made the total of <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> shots. To make monitoring of his own results easier for him, one rather well-known programmer (of course it is you) was commissioned to write a program that would reveal how many and which targets Valera hit. More specifically, for each target the program must print the number of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">the first</span> successful shot (in the target), or &quot;-1&quot; if this was not hit. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">The target is considered hit if the shot is inside the circle or on its boundary.</span> Valera is counting on you and perhaps, thanks to you he will one day win international competitions.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line of the input file contains the integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class="upper-index">4</sup></span>), which is the number of targets.
