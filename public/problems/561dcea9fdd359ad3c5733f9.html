For example, they learned how the chief of the ancient Berland tribe was chosen.</p><p>As soon as enough pretenders was picked, the following test took place among them: the chief of the tribe took a slab divided by horizontal and vertical stripes into identical squares (the slab consisted of <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> lines and <span class="tex-span"><i>M</i></span> columns) and painted every square black or white. Then every pretender was given a slab of the same size but painted entirely white. Within a day a pretender could paint any side-linked set of the squares of the slab some color. The set is called linked if for any two squares belonging to the set there is a path belonging the set on which any two neighboring squares share a side. The aim of each pretender is to paint his slab in the exactly the same way as the chief&#x2019;s slab is painted. The one who paints a slab like that first becomes the new chief.</p><p>Scientists found the slab painted by the ancient Berland tribe chief. Help them to determine the minimal amount of days needed to find a new chief if he had to paint his slab in the given way.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>M</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>N</i>,&#x2009;<i>M</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;50</span>) &#x2014; the number of lines and columns on the slab.
