He never listens to them right away. Instead, he compiles them into a playlist. When he feels that his mind is open to new music, he opens the playlist and starts to listen to the songs.</p><p>Of course, there are some songs that Manao doesn&apos;t particuarly enjoy. To get more pleasure from the received songs, he invented the following procedure of listening to the playlist:</p><ul> <li> If after listening to some song Manao realizes that he liked it, then he remembers it and starts to listen to the next unlistened song. </li><li> If after listening to some song Manao realizes that he did not like it, he listens to all the songs he liked up to this point and then begins to listen to the next unlistened song. </li></ul><p>For example, if Manao has four songs in the playlist, A, B, C, D (in the corresponding order) and he is going to like songs A and C in the end, then the order of listening is the following:</p><ol> <li> Manao listens to A, he likes it, he remembers it. </li><li> Manao listens to B, he does not like it, so he listens to A, again. </li><li> Manao listens to C, he likes the song and he remembers it, too. </li><li> Manao listens to D, but does not enjoy it and re-listens to songs A and C. </li></ol><p>That is, in the end Manao listens to song A three times, to song C twice and songs B and D once. Note that if Manao once liked a song, he will never dislike it on a subsequent listening.</p><p>Manao has received <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> songs: the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th of them is <span class="tex-span"><i>l</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> seconds long and Manao may like it with a probability of <span class="tex-span"><i>p</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> percents. The songs could get on Manao&apos;s playlist in any order, so Manao wants to know the maximum expected value of the number of seconds after which the listening process will be over, for all possible permutations of the songs in the playlist.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;50000</span>).
