Some of these panels are painted. We shall assume that the Geo Panels without color are painted the transparent color. </p><p>Besides, the map has so-called Geo Symbols. They look like pyramids of different colors (including Geo Symbols of the transparent color). Each Geo Symbol is located on one Geo Panel, and each Geo Panel may contain no more than one Geo Symbol. </p><p>Geo Symbols can be eliminated. To understand better what happens when a Geo Symbol is eliminated, let us introduce some queue to which we will put the recently eliminated Geo Symbols. </p><p>Let&apos;s put at the head of the queue a Geo Symbol that was eliminated just now. Next, we will repeat the following operation: </p><p>Extract the Geo Symbol from the queue. Look at the color of the panel containing the given Geo Symbol. If it <span class="tex-font-style-bf">differs from transparent</span> and differs from the color of the Geo Symbol, then all Geo Panels of this color are repainted in the color of the given Geo Symbol (transparent Geo Symbols repaint the Geo Panels transparent). Repainting is executed in an infinite spiral strictly in the following order starting from the panel, which contained the Geo Symbol: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="http://codeforces.com/predownloaded/f4/59/f459b9f7233cf6688c4819717d77c907de4dc999.png"> </center><p>In other words, we select all the panels that need to be repainted and find their numbers in the infinite spiral whose center is placed in the position of the given Geo Symbol. After that, we repaint them in the order of the number&apos;s increasing. </p><p>If a panel contains another Geo Symbol and this panel is being repainted, then the Geo Symbol is removed from the field and placed at the tail of the queue. </p><p>After repainting the Geo Symbol is completely eliminated and the next Geo Symbol is taken from the head of the queue (if there is any) and the process repeats. The process ends if the queue is empty. </p><p>See the sample analysis for better understanding. </p><p>You know the colors of all the Geo Panels and the location of all the Geo Symbols. Determine the number of repaintings, which will occur if you destroy one of the Geo Symbols.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>,&#x2009;<i>m</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;300</span>) &#x2014; the height and the width of the map (in cells).</p><p>Then follow <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> line; each of them contains <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> numbers &#x2014; the Geo Panels&apos; colors.</p><p>Then follow <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> more lines; each of them contains <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> numbers &#x2014; the Geo Symbols&apos; description. -1 means that the given position contains no Geo Symbol.
