He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha&apos;s direction every <span class="tex-span"><i>a</i></span> minutes, but a train goes to Masha&apos;s direction every <span class="tex-span"><i>b</i></span> minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).</p><p>We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears.

Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains&apos; arrival will be periodic with period 6.
