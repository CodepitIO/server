Naturally, Dima, as all other men who have girlfriends, does everything wrong.</p><p>Inna and Dima are now in one room. Inna tells Dima off for everything he does in her presence. After Inna tells him off for something, she goes to another room, walks there in circles muttering about how useless her sweetheart is. During that time Dima has time to peacefully complete <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i>&#x2009;-&#x2009;1</span> tasks. Then Inna returns and tells Dima off for the next task he does in her presence and goes to another room again. It continues until Dima is through with his tasks.</p><p>Overall, Dima has <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> tasks to do, each task has a unique number from <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span>. Dima loves order, so he does tasks consecutively, starting from some task. For example, if Dima has <span class="tex-span">6</span> tasks to do in total, then, if he starts from the <span class="tex-span">5</span>-th task, the order is like that: first Dima does the <span class="tex-span">5</span>-th task, then the <span class="tex-span">6</span>-th one, then the <span class="tex-span">1</span>-st one, then the <span class="tex-span">2</span>-nd one, then the <span class="tex-span">3</span>-rd one, then the <span class="tex-span">4</span>-th one.</p><p>Inna tells Dima off (only lovingly and appropriately!) so often and systematically that he&apos;s very well learned the power with which she tells him off for each task. Help Dima choose the first task so that in total he gets told off with as little power as possible.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i>,&#x2009;<i>k</i>&#xA0;(1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>k</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class="upper-index">5</sup>)</span>.

Thus, Dima gets told off with total power 3 + 1 + 5 = 9. If Dima started from the second task, for example, then Inna would tell him off for tasks 2, 4 and 6 with power 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. </p><p>Explanation of the second example.</p><p>In the second example <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span> = 5, thus, Dima manages to complete 4 tasks in-between the telling off sessions. Thus, Inna tells Dima off for tasks number 1 and 6 (if he starts from 1 or 6), 2 and 7 (if he starts from 2 or 7) and so on. The optimal answer is to start from task 3 or 8, 3 has a smaller number, so the answer is 3.</p></div></div></div>
