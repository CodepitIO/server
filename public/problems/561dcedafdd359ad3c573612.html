He can&apos;t write programs but he loves to watch the contests&apos; progress. Vasya even has a favorite coder and Vasya pays special attention to him.</p><p>One day Vasya decided to collect the results of all contests where his favorite coder participated and track the progress of his coolness. For each contest where this coder participated, he wrote out a single non-negative number &#x2014; the number of points his favorite coder earned in the contest. Vasya wrote out the points for the contest in the order, in which the contests run (naturally, no two contests ran simultaneously).</p><p>Vasya considers a coder&apos;s performance in a contest <span class="tex-font-style-it">amazing</span> in two situations: he can break either his best or his worst performance record. First, it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly <span class="tex-font-style-bf">more</span> points that he earned on each past contest. Second, it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly <span class="tex-font-style-bf">less</span> points that he earned on each past contest. A coder&apos;s first contest isn&apos;t considered amazing. Now he wants to count the number of amazing performances the coder had throughout his whole history of participating in contests. But the list of earned points turned out long and Vasya can&apos;t code... That&apos;s why he asks you to help him.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains the single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1000</span>) &#x2014; the number of contests where the coder participated.</p><p>The next line contains <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> space-separated non-negative integer numbers &#x2014; they are the points which the coder has earned.
